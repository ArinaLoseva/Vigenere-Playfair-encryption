# Vigenere-and-Playfair-encryption
code for Windows Form application for text encryption using Vigenуre +  Playfair methods
## About
Programming language: C#
This small code is just my training lab, which may come in handy :)
## Assignment
Develop a windowed software tool for encryption and
decryption of data using the Playfair cipher with
using the Playfair encryption key via
Vigenère cryptosystem.
The program provides two modes: encryption and
decryption. When encrypted, the text message is entered into the field
input. The encrypted message is displayed on the screen and saved in
text file.
For decryption, the ciphertext is loaded from the file.
Next, the encrypted text is loaded into the input field.
To obtain the key for the Playfair cipher, use
Vigenere cryptosystem. The key for the cryptosystem is entered into the fields
Vigenère and the message that will serve as the future key for the cipher
Playfair (after encryption through the Vigenère cryptosystem).
Based on the converted key, a new matrix-alphabet of the cipher is constructed
Playfair and displayed on the screen.
